# First project: Drive and Survive

## About the project
In this project, I show the impact of Formula One racing on air pollution levels. By analyzing data from various Grand Prix locations, I aim to identify patterns of pollution during events. All pollution from the race weekend is inspected, no single sources are identified.  
All data is gathered through APIs. The focus of the project is on showing comparison data from several years to find patterns. A small amount of EDA is made to obtain some visuals and all visuals are created in Tableau Public.
