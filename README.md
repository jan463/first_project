# First project: Drive and Survive

## About the project
In this project, I show the impact of Formula One racing on air pollution levels. By analyzing data from various Grand Prix locations, I aim to identify patterns of pollution during events. **All pollution from the race weekend is inspected, no single sources are identified.**  
The project is neither pro nor contra Formula One racing and only shows data. This can be interpreted either way after thoroughly collecting more data and facts.

All data is gathered through APIs. The focus of the project is on showing comparison data from several years to find patterns. A small amount of EDA is made to obtain some visuals and all visuals are created in Tableau Public.  

The repo contains the final presentation as pdf. It is a short presentation which must only take 10 minutes. Nowhere near all data can be showed so I made a choice to show the most interesting and representative data.

## Conclusions
**Hypothesis 1:**  
The pollution from formula one races is measurable.  
Yes it is measurable, after each racing session an increase of air pollution is measurable. **But this is not in every event visible the same.** In the presentation are two examples with clearly measurable results.  

**Hypothesis 2:**  
Formula one cars are not the biggest problem regarding air pollution.  
In the presentation there is a graph of Imola over the whole year of 2021 and the race weekend states no peak in air pollution. This is representable data as in all tested cases the race weekend did not produce the highest peak in air pollution.

## How to use it
To use my code you can clone my repo. The F1 API works without private key. For the Open Weather Map API a private key is needed but it can be used for free.  

Using the existing code a lot of data can be extracted.  
With the F1 API the whole race calendar is available as well as times and dates for the practicing and qualifying sessions.  
The Open Weather Map Air Pollution API delivers data for different substances like particle matter, CO, NOX etc. Also the categorical Air Quality Index AQI can be obtained.
